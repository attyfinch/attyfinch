### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Brad Morris. After a 15 year career in marketing and 5 years focused on investing, I got the itch to build things and learn to code. For the past 9 months I've been attending the BloomTech Full Stack Web Dev course where I've learned JavaScript, Node, React, Express, a bit of SQL, and whole lot more. I just finished my first project [WordleAssist](https://www.wordleassist.dev/)([Repo](https://github.com/attyfinch/wordle-assist), a simple web app that helps solve Wordle puzzles. Please check it out!
